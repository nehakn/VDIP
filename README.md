It computes site-specific soil line using NIR-Red band spectral space. Further, it estimates vegetation and drought indices that can be used to analyze agricultural land, soil conditions, crop health, etc.

The user selects corrected Red and NIR band images, shape file for the region of interest, directory for storing the outputs and can choose whether to compute local soil line or not. Then, user can choose parameters that he wishes to compute.
